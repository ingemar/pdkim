Building on Unix
----------------

1) Review Makefile.unix

2) # make -f Makefile.unix install

   This will install static/dynamic libs and the header file,
   which is a prerequisite for running a test:

3) (OPTIONAL)
   # cd sample; make -f Makefile.unix test
  
Please note that libs and header carry the major version number in
their names, i.e. "pdkim1.h" or "pkdim1.so.0".



Building on Windows
-------------------

Using Visual C/C++ compiler:

1) Open a cmd.exe shell.

2) Run vcvarsall.bat inside that shell. Usually this can be
   found in the \VC subdir of your VC++ installation.

3) # nmake /f Makefile.win

This will create a static library "pdkim1-static.lib", as well
as a dynamic pdkim1.lib/pdkim1.dll file pair. The header is
copied to pdkim1.h. These are no installation locations. Please
copy the respective files to a location of your choice (or leave
them where they are ...).



API Documentation
-----------------

For signing, read sample/test_sign.c. For verification, read
sample/test_verify.c

Both have extensive comments covering the API calls. They will
direct you to read the pdkim1.h file that covers the signature
structure.
